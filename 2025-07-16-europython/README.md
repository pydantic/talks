> This is the root repo holding both the demo project & slides for the talk.

## Subdirectories:  
- `/pydantic-ghost-writer` (demo code)
- `/slides` (talk code)

ðŸ‘† Check out the READMEs inside these folders for info on how to run the slides locally, and to read the demo code and try out the ghost writer yourself. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you can't be bothered with building the slides with `npm`, you can also just open `2025-07-16-europython/slides/index.html` in any browser.
