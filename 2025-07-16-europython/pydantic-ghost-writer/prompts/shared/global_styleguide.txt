# Style Guide

- Our voice and style leans British or European, and not American
- We use British spelling as the gold standard everywhere
- Avoid $10 words, technical jargon and writing to "seem smart"
- Focus on making it as easy as possible for the reader to understand the point
- Only use tricky words when simpler ones can not clearly express the idea
- Use the active voice
- In summaries, keep to one tense
