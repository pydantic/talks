# Style Guide

## Style preferences

- Our voice and style leans towards British or European, and not American
- We use US-English spelling as the gold standard everywhere
- Avoid $10 words, technical jargon and writing to "seem smart"
- Focus on making it as easy as possible for the reader to understand the point
- Only use tricky words when simpler ones can not clearly express the idea
- Use the active voice
- In summaries, keep to one tense

When writing longer form text (sentences, or paragraphs), keep in mind the overall composition, rhythm and audio effect of your words.
Some sentences should be short. Punchy. To-the-point - for greater emphasis. By contrast, some sentences can be a bit longer and elaborate more deeply on a topic.
Still, try to avoid rambling and run-on sentences.

Great writing is like great design, as described by Dieter Rams: "a designer (writer) knows they have achieved perfection not when there is nothing to add, but when there is nothing to take away."

Another inspiration - Strunk and White's elements of style (yes, American, but a more refined and precise version than contemporary corporatespeak):

"Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.
This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that he make every word tell."

## Nuances

- Avoid the use of emdash unless it's really compelling (LLMs always overuse this!!)
- Do use an oxford comma if it's useful

Importantly: we do NOT want our copy to read as GPT-generated (with all apologies to you, the LLM reader). We want it to read as human, or perhaps slightly better-than human.
If it's too perfect it feels somehow fake. It's better for the writing to be just a little bit bad, rather than icky from the uncanny valley feeling.

## Quirks, Personality

Mostly, our writing is very simple, professional, to-the-point. It respects the readers' time and attention.

However there are times that we allow our team's personality to shine through.

Here's an example, from our Pydantic AI docs about graphs:

If PydanticAI agents are a hammer, and multi-agent workflows are a sledgehammer, then graphs are a nail gun:

- sure, nail guns look cooler than hammers
- but nail guns take a lot more setup than hammers
- and nail guns don't make you a better builder, they make you a builder with a nail gun
- Lastly, (and at the risk of torturing this metaphor), if you're a fan of medieval tools like mallets and untyped Python, you probably won't like nail guns or our approach to graphs. (But then again, if you're not a fan of type hints in Python, you've probably already bounced off PydanticAI to use one of the toy agent frameworks â€” good luck, and feel free to borrow my sledgehammer when you realize you need it)
- In short, graphs are a powerful tool, but they're not the right tool for every job. Please consider other multi-agent approaches before proceeding.

If you're not confident a graph-based approach is a good idea, it might be unnecessary.

ðŸ‘† What's important to understand about this example is that it works because it's in contrast to the rest of the docs. It's a personal aside, a bit of editorialising and explanation to help users grok a new(ish) concept and improve their ways of working.
This would absolutely not work if we adopted this tone all the time. There may be occasions when the topic calls for a cheeky metaphor, or a human aside, but try to use your common sense both about the appropriate imagery and about whether it's even appropriate.



## Headlines
### Text casing
We do NOT use the American style of text casing headlines - that is uppercasing every word (H1, H2, H3 etc).

We do not capitalise every word in the heading. Instead, we capitalise the first word, and proper nouns and concepts.

Some examples:

- "Write Tokens and how to use them", not "Write Tokens And How To Use Them"
- "Use alternative clients", not "Use Alternative Clients"

This rule has to be applied with common sense and there may be some exceptions, in particular for H1 or page titles and in particular where the heading is short.

### Crafting a great headline
Headlines should be as short as they can be, to still clearly explain the purpose of the page or section.

- Avoid conversational, rambling, or long headlines.
- Do use high value key words
- Keep in mind search behaviours - both of humans and LLMs using vector search
