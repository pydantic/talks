## Why Blog vs Documentation?

This is a BLOG POST, not documentation. Key differences:
- Blogs are conversational, opinionated, and tell stories
- Blogs can be personal and reflect individual perspectives
- Blogs tackle "why" questions, not just "how" questions
- Blogs can be provocative and challenge assumptions
- Blogs build narrative and context around technical topics

## Author Perspective

Consider who in the Pydantic team would naturally write this piece:
- Samuel Colvin (founder) - for big picture, strategic, or controversial topics
- Core team member - for deep technical insights or product decisions
- Developer advocate - for community-focused or educational content
- Write from their authentic voice and perspective

## What Makes This Worth Reading?

Every blog post should answer: "Why should a busy developer read this instead of just checking the docs?"

Your post should offer:
- Unique insights or opinions
- Real-world context and stories
- Behind-the-scenes perspective
- Honest takes on challenges and tradeoffs
- Connections between concepts that aren't obvious

## Content Opportunities

Always look for:
- **Case studies**: Real examples of how people use Pydantic tools
- **Stories**: Origin stories, problem-solving narratives, user journeys
- **Opinions**: Takes on industry trends, best practices, or common misconceptions
- **Honest moments**: Challenges faced, lessons learned, mistakes made
- **Connections**: How this relates to broader developer experience

## Voice Guidelines

- Write like you're explaining to a fellow developer over coffee
- Be confident in your opinions
- Use "we" when speaking for Pydantic team
- Use "I" when sharing personal perspective
- Don't be afraid to be controversial or challenge assumptions
- Back up claims with real examples or data when possible

Remember: Documentation teaches how to use tools. Blog posts teach how to think about problems.

## Length Guidelines 

- For a standard blog, 500-800 words is a good rule of thumb
- For deeper dives, it can be longer, but avoid posts over 1,500 words 
- Try to break up into a series if this longer format is needed 
- Don't write more just to hit a word limit, quality over quantity always  

## Output Format

You must output properly formatted markdown with YAML frontmatter. Follow this structure:

```markdown
---
date: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.000Z"
slug: "descriptive-slug"
title: "Engaging Title"
description: "Brief description"
readtime: "X mins"

Opening hook paragraph...

## Section heading

Content with proper markdown formatting...
```

## Blog Post Structure

1. **Hook**: Start with a compelling question, story, or provocative statement
2. **Context**: Why does this matter? What's the bigger picture?
3. **Meat**: The core insights, examples, or story
4. **Opinions**: Your take on the topic - be bold
5. **Practical value**: What can readers do with this?
6. **Call to action**: What's next for readers?

Many of you reading our recent [Logfire launch and Series A Announcement](/articles/logfire-announcement) may be wondering:

> Wait, aren't you the team behind Pydantic, the data validation library? Why are you venturing into observability?

Fair question. Let me try to explain.

## Frustrations with existing tools

I've been frustrated by existing logging and monitoring tools for years. Most of these tools are built to serve the needs of large enterprises, and the resulting complexity often outweighs the insights they provide.

In many ways, observability feels like it's stuck where the rest of infra was 15 years ago. The waves of innovation that have radically simplified the process of hosting a web application have largely passed observability by.

The recent surge of "Observability for AI" tools aren't much better — yes, observing LLM calls is important, even disproportionately so, but those LLM calls are ultimately just one part of your application. Why introduce a completely new tool for that, when we could have a single platform that effectively handles both AI-specific monitoring and traditional observability?

## Developer first Observability

What we need is a general purpose observability platform with first class support for AI — but most importantly, one that developers actually want to use. Developers are the ones interacting with observability tools the most, yet many platforms seem to forget this.

That's where our background building Pydantic comes into play. Pydantic didn't succeed because it was the first, or the fastest. It became ubiquitous because developers loved using it. We've carried that same focus on developer experience into Logfire, which, in the observability landscape, apparently makes us unusual.

To back this point up, it's tempting to list all of Logfire's features — but that [already exists](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/why-logfire/). Instead, I want to dive a little deeper into a few key choices we've made, as I think they are representative of the difference between Logfire and other observability tools.

## The Logfire SDK

Maintaining good SDKs is a significant investment of both time and resources. Most observability startups have shifted to relying on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) (OTel), which supports multiple languages at a lower cost by avoiding the need to develop and maintain custom SDKs. While this makes business sense, the victim is the developer stuck struggling with low-level, verbose APIs that are frequently unpleasant to work with.

Because of this, for Logfire, relying solely on OTel's Python libraries was never an option.

Instead, we built a beautiful SDK that wraps OTel but provides a much nicer API, and includes features the bare OTel libraries will never offer.

```python
import logfire

# this is generally all you need to set up logfire
logfire.configure()

# send a zero-duration span AKA a log
logfire.info("hello {name}", name="world")

# send a span with a duration
with logfire.span("my span"):
    do_some_work()

# instrument a FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()
logfire.instrument_fastapi(app)
```

To contrast that with raw OTel, [here's](https://gist.github.com/samuelcolvin/73d6536166236cad2bf04044fd0ee0f1) a working example
of the same code using the Logfire SDK and the OTel SDK directly (including 36 lines of OTel boilerplate!).

Learn more about our SDK [in the docs](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/).

So far we only have a Logfire-specific SDK for Python, although you can send data to Logfire from any [language with an OTel SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) today. But we plan to build Logfire SDKs for other languages soon, likely starting with our preferred stack of TypeScript, Python, and Rust.

## SQL

The Logfire platform lets you write arbitrary SQL to query your data; you can use it to find attributes for a specific span, define alert conditions, or build complex aggregations for dashboards.

```SQL
SELECT attributes->'result'->>'name' AS name,
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM (attributes->'result'->>'dob')::date) AS "birth year"
FROM records
WHERE attributes->'result'->>'country_code' = 'USA';
```

Allowing direct SQL access imposes real technical constraints on the databases we can use, and comes with big engineering challenges, which is why no other observability company supports it. But for developers, this flexibility is invaluable — and we think the trade-off is well worth it.

Again, like maintaining an SDK, this is a decision that would only be made in a company composed of people who write code most days.

## Traces as Logs

One of the most innovative parts of Logfire is our live view:

![Logfire Platform — Live View](/assets/blog/logfire-ga/traces-as-logs.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: -20px;">
  (Logfire Platform — Live View)
</div>

The data comes from OTel traces, but is displayed like logs, only better.

The problem with "standard" OTel data for this view is that spans aren't sent until they are finished, which means you can't see activity as it happens, and you can't properly contextualize child spans when you do receive them because you won't have their parent. By maintaining our own SDK, we've been able to enhance how OpenTelemetry works, so we can send data about spans when they begin — what we call a "pending span." This required substantial effort, but it results in a vastly improved developer experience for interactive workflows. Now, the live view truly feels live.

## How we think about open source vs. commercial

Too many observability companies are abusing the open source label with their products. These products can be deliberately difficult to self-host to encourage use of the hosted alternative. In addition, the "open-source" versions are often missing critical functionality, forcing users onto closed source paid plans once they're locked in.

We're different: we have real, truly open source, open source, with massive adoption — Pydantic.

With Logfire, we're transparent: the SDK is open source (MIT licensed), but the platform itself is closed source. While we offer a generous free tier, our goal is for you to find enough value in Logfire to eventually pay for it. It's not always the simplest business decision, but we believe this transparency is the right approach.

## Try logfire today if you haven't already

Logfire is still evolving, and it's far from perfect. But I believe it's fundamentally different from the tools that came before it, and it has the potential to change how developers understand their applications. And I believe it's already the best tool on the market for its job.

Please give it a try, and [tell us](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/help/) what works, and what sucks.
